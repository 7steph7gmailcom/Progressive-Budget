# Progressive-Budget

#### Progressive Budget assignment is an application that allows its users to track their finances whether or not they have access to internet service or not. A user should be able to track expenses by entering income or expenses and having them add or subtract from the current balance of their account. IndexedDb should aid in the user in having the most up to date balance regardless of their connection to the internet. This application was to be deployed to the Heroku server when completed. Both links for the Github repository and the deployed page in Heroku have been provided.
